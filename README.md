<b>Extras : </b> <br>
Creating this game really helped wrap my head around Inheritance. <br>
I was having a problem with it before,<br>
but I managed to get it to work in GemData, Coins, Ruby, and Emerald classes, <br>
AND it helped me from not writing repetitive code!<br><br>
I drew all the artwork myself (as childish as it may seem) <br>
I had a lot of fun drawing!.<br>
And finally, I love the business mans mustache,<br>
it really was the inspiration of this game!
